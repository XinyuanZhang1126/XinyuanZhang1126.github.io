I am an incoming MPhil student in Computer Science at **CUHK-Shenzhen**, School of Data Science, starting in Sept. 2025. I am fortunate to be supervised by [**Dr. Juexiao Zhou**](https://www.joshuachou.ink/about/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, and **Healthcare**. I am particularly passionate about leveraging intelligent systems to enhance healthcare experiences and outcomes through intuitive and human-centered design.

In July 2024, I graduated with First Class Honours in Information and Computing Science from Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU), where I was supervised by **Dr. Yu Liu** and **Prof. Lingyun Yu**. My undergraduate research focused on **Data Visualization** and **Human-Computer Interaction**.

Outside of academia, I enjoy dancing and traveling. I have two cats, 火锅 and 呆呆, who make everyday life more fun.
