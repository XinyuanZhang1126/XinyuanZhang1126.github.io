In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of diverse geo-infographics available on the internet, closely examining the specifics of their visual elements. As a result, we formulated a design space that incorporates five key design dimensions: basic map representations, map projections, visual encoding channels, highlighting techniques, and label placement. Through the systematic review and exploration of a multitude of visual design strategies, we aim to provide an overview of visual elements that can be used for crafting compelling geo-infographics. Moreover, this work serves as a stepping stone towards the development of an intelligently assisted generation system tailored for the creation of sophisticated geo-infographics.
